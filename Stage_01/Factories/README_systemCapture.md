SYSTEM CAPTURE FACTORY,

Stage 2: SystemCaptureFactory
Role: Manages the camera capture pipeline and frame processing.
Key Components:
SystemCaptureFactory.h: Factory class for managing multiple camera instances.
SdlDisplayConcrete.h: Displays frames captured from the camera and processed by the algorithm.
üîç Observations & Improvements

Multiple Camera Support: Your factory initializes one camera instance (DataConcrete). Consider adding dynamic camera handling for future scalability.
Resource Management: Ensure that the camera device is not re-initialized if already opened.

Stage 3: SystemProfilingFactory
Role: Performs real-time system profiling for performance and energy efficiency.
Key Components:
SystemProfilingFactory.h: Monitors SoC performance and logs CPU/GPU usage.
ISystemProfiling.h: Abstract interface for profiling methods.
PerformanceLogger.h: Writes profiling data to PerformanceMetrics.csv.
jetsonNanoInfo.h: Retrieves hardware information from Jetson Nano.
üîç Observations & Improvements

Profiling is not reporting CPU/GPU usage correctly (CPU1 0%@0MHz).
Ensure jetsonNanoInfo.h accesses /sys/devices/system/cpu/ or /proc/stat correctly.
Add fallback mechanisms if tegrastats is unavailable.
Logging Optimization:
Your profiling loop runs every 1 second (std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));).
Consider using a non-blocking mechanism instead of sleep for better efficiency.

Stage 4: ConcreteComponentFactory
Role: Composes various components into a functional pipeline.
Key Components:
ConcreteComponentFactory.h: Combines camera, algorithm, profiling, and display.
üîç Observations & Improvements

Dependency Injection: Ensure the factory initializes components in a controlled order (SoC ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Algorithm ‚Üí Profiling ‚Üí Display).
Extensibility:
Consider making it easier to swap algorithms dynamically.
üîπ Stage 5: User Interface (main.cpp)
Role: Entry point that initializes and executes the framework.
Key Flow:
Initializes SoC, Algorithm, and Camera.
Sets up profiling.
Runs for 20 seconds before stopping.
üîç Observations & Improvements

Error Handling: Add try/catch blocks around profiling and camera initialization.
Interactive Mode: Consider adding a CLI menu to start/stop profiling dynamically.

Below is one complete example of an ‚Äúintegrated‚Äêsolution‚Äù that uses the new SharedQueue‚Äìbased pipeline. In this example the factories and test framework are updated so that:

The DataConcrete (capture) component pushes every captured frame to two queues:
One for the algorithm (to be processed)
One for the display (to show the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù image)
The AlgorithmConcrete component reads from the algorithm‚Äôs input queue, processes the frame, and then pushes the processed frame into a ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù queue.
The SdlDisplayConcrete component is constructed with references to both the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù and ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù queues and internally spawns threads that continuously pop frames, convert from YUYV to RGB, and update its textures.


Summary
SharedQueue.h
A thread-safe producer-consumer queue.

ThreadManager.h
Centralizes thread creation, joining, and an optional task-based thread pool.

SystemModelingFactory_new.h
Stage-1 factory that sets up SoC, Data, Algorithm, and Display components, injecting SharedQueue objects for communication.

SystemCaptureFactory_new.h
Stage-2 factory that manages the lifecycle of camera capture, optional algorithm processing, SoC monitoring, and the display pipeline.

SdlDisplayConcrete_new.h
SDL2-based display implementation that reads from two shared queues (original & processed frames) and renders them side-by-side.

DataConcrete_new.h
Camera (V4L2) concrete class that dequeues frames and pushes them to both the algorithm and display queues.

AlgorithmConcrete_new.h
Example algorithm pipeline with multiple modes (invert, grayscale, etc.), running in a separate thread that reads from inputQueue_ and writes to outputQueue_.
